# This is an end to end project on image classification.
The project features:

##### Data Cleaning
In image classification, especially one for classifying people, the most important part of an image is usually the face.  
Hence, data cleaning in image classification is usually getting the relevant part of an image then discarding the 
irrelevant parts of it. In this case, cropping the face of the person in the image an discarding the rest of it. 
##### Feature Engineering
Extracting features from an image is achievable by treating said image as a 2D signal and understanding the image frequency. The frequency is simple
##### Model training
CNNs models are generally used for image classification but I decided to use SVM classifier. 
##### Web app development
A web app that can use the trained model for image classification. 
##### Model deployment to AWS
Hosted the web app on AWS EC2 instance.
